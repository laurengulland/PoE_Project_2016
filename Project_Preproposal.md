# Project Pre-proposal
*[View Assignment Here](http://poe.olin.edu/preproposal.html) -- Due Sunday October 16, 2016*

## Project Goal
Our overall project goal is to make a fountain that disperses a vertical sheet of water which is programmable to make different designs. 

__Our MVP:__ Have a curtain that displays a variety of images controlled via a microcontroller, and succesfully collects and recycles water to be self-sustaining.

__For a step one iteration__ (~sprint 1 or 2, or whenever we get the physical parts), we're shooting for: getting one or two nozzles actuating decently well, figuring out the physics of the water that we'll need to be interacting with, and hopefully being able to draw simple lines or something (hand-input) with the two nozzles to prove that we have control over the system. 

__Our Dream Goal would include:__
A tablet or other device that can be used for user input into the system to determine designs; variable lighting to make it look awesome; be large and self-sustaining enough to become a permanent art piece on campus! 

__Our biggest challenges__ will probably include waterproofing, budgeting and ordering parts, and scoping (e.g. time management, integration, etc.). Also, where this will end up is something we need to figure out. Speaking of which.... We would love to talk to the teaching team more about how to make this a sustainable art project that could stick around in the school somewhere. We would be really excited by making something that could be large enough to become a permanent art piece, but we've definitely heard from the Ninjas that this would be pretty difficult. We'll probably come talk to you all relatively soon to figure out scoping and end products!
