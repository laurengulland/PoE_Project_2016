##Original Assingment text (to be deleted upon completion of assignment, just here for reference)
The goal of the preproposal is to identify and describe the project youâ€™d like to work on for the remainder of the semester. Your preproposal should describe the basic concept and functionality of your project. Where possible, you should outline what you anticipate to be the biggest challenges to project implementation. If there exist different media representations of inspiration for your idea (videos, photos, etc.), please include links.
The preproposal should be no more than 1 page. One reasonably detailed paragraph would be an acceptable length.
